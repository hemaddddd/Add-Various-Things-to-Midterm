# Add-Various-Things-to-Midterm

So I made a new level for this assignment, and I added two doors and two keys that can be picke up by pressing F key (I don't have the model for the key so I did it with knive models) and key can only open door one, key two can only open door two. between them there is a glass wall, the enemies can see the player but they won't be able to hit the player. instead, they have to go through the grass walls and kill the player. I used loops to build a moving wall, and it blocks the enemies' attack from far side.
